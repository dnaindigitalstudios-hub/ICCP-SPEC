> 🗣️ *"Not an API. A language."*  
> ICCP is a minimal, schema-first protocol for AI agents to *propose*, *negotiate*, and *audit* actions—before execution.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

| **Traditional APIs** | **ICCP** |
|----------------------|----------|
| Request → Response (synchronous) | Intent → Verdict (asynchronous) |
| Endpoint sprawl | Topic-based broadcast |
| Logs are *post-hoc* | Decisions are *pre-execution* |
| Human-written contracts | Machine-verifiable schema |

ICCP turns every agent interaction into a **constitutional negotiation** — where intent is serialized, judged, and immutably logged.
